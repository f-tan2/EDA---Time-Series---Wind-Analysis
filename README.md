# EDA---Time-Series---Wind-Analysis

The use of renewable energy resources for utility electricity generation is becoming increasingly popular around the world. When considering adding more renewable sources to a generation portfolio, utilities must consider the feasibility and potential benefits of a renewable source in specific locations. Two of the main sources of renewable energy are wind and solar energy. Using photovoltaics or wind turbines can provide clean energy, but the output of these energy sources rely heavily on local weather conditions. Solar energy can only be captured during daylight hours and it performs better in locations with higher solar radiation. Wind turbines can only operate in locations with predictable winds and are limited by a minimum required wind speed to turn the turbine and a maximum wind speed at which it is safe to operate.
In this report, we will examine weather conditions in Deer Lodge, Montana and Ashton, Idaho. We will analyze wind direction, peak wind gust, wind speed, and solar radiation over a one year period in 2014 in order to determine feasibility of using solar and/or wind generation.
